# DiplomaProject
DiplomaProject is a Moodle activity plugin designed to streamline the graduation thesis selection and assignment process. It facilitates the interaction between students and supervisors by allowing students to browse available topics, submit their preferences, and upload required documents. Supervisors can then review, approve, or assign topics directly within the course.

Key features include:

    Topic browsing and selection by students

    Supervisor assignment and topic approval

    Annex/form upload and management

    Centralized dashboard for tracking all diploma project progress

This plugin helps automate and organize the entire workflow of final project selection, making the administrative process smoother for both students and academic staff.
