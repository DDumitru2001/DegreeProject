# DegreeProject
DegreeProject is a Moodle activity plugin designed to streamline the graduation thesis selection and assignment process. It facilitates the interaction between students and supervisors by allowing students to browse available topics, submit their preferences, and upload required documents. Supervisors can then review, approve, or assign topics.
